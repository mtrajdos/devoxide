Placebo subjects into lower ICV and IQ and upper ICV and IQ subsets - lower ICV, upper ICV quantiles; lower IQ, upper IQ quantiles.

Small research question:
Are upper and lower ICV and IQ groups different in terms of their score and time performance?

Independent t-tests:
# Ho: Score means are not different between lower and upper ICV
# t(298)=-0.29, p=0.77, Ho accepted

# Ho: Time means are not different between lower and upper ICV
# t(297)=1.48, p=0.14, Ho accepted

# Ha: Score means are different between lower and upper IQ
# t(298)=-7.44, p=1.08e-12, Ho rejected

# Ha: Time means are different between lower and upper IQ
# t(297)=3.60, p=3.7e-04, Ho rejected

Big research question:
Do placebo subjects improve in scores and times at the same rate regardless of their ICV and IQ?

MANOVAs:

Multi-level analyses:

(expected to accept Ha and come up with some sort of a correction for the effect of test familiarity - in this case for 0mg,
but probably separate corrections for dosages are needed as well)

Post-hoc tests (Wilcoxon?) with effect sizes of familiarity with the brain functions test.
Repeated or independent contrasts?
